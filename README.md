# Assignment "Wrapping Up the Portfolio"
This final assignment has given me the opportunity to create a [resume](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/bc8aa512d9721dc914da9b93e87177505a5379dc/resume.md) as well as to write a summary covering the experiences I've gained in this course.

Summary paragraph:
Through this course, my skills in machine learning have drastically improved. This course has allowed me to gain experience in creating classification and regression models through languages, tools, and libraries such as R, R Studio, Python, Keras, Seaborn, Sklearn, and Google Colab. With these tools, I've been able to create linear regression models, develop algorithms from scratch in C++, explore regression, clasffication, and dimensionality reduction, utlizie Sklearn to perform logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, and finally practice image classification. The experiences I've gained in this course have only further fostered my interest in machine learning and my enthusiasm towards continuing to learn. In terms of future personal projects, I would love to work more with image classification. Personally, our image classification assignment was the most interesting (at no disparity to the other assignments) and I would love to do more projects in my own time centered around this area of machine learning. I would also like to continue to use machine learning in future competitions since, now, I feel I have a solid foundation and understanding of how to utilize machine learning for a wide variety of potential challenges. In keeping up with this rapidly changing field, I plan to utilize the same sources as with many other spheres of computer science: videos and news articles. I'm quickly approaching graduation, and with that, I realize I have to find spaces beyond the classroom to continue to learn. I've found some easily accessible places online that, I'm sure, will open the door for me to continue to learn about machine learning in the future. Speaking on the future, I would be more than happy working in a career with machine learning as its focus. Just as with this class, I've greatly appreciated the opportunities I've had and will surely embrace any in the future.
