# Portfolio-Setup
This is my portfolio setup for Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 4375.004). 

# Assignment "Portfolio Setup"
I was successful in setting up my Github for this course! For this assignment, you can see my [overview of machine learning](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/overview_of_machine_learning.pdf).

# Assignment "C++ Data Exploration"

# Assignment "C++ Algorithms from Scratch"
This assignment was focused on exploring logistic regression and Naive Bayes. In this assignment, I had used logistic regression and Naive Bayes to predict whether or not a passenger on the Titanic may have survived (you can see my data set [here](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/1f9e3e9c2dbc9f01f5ac9f0107d1dc573fe7de0f/C++_Algorithms_from_Scratch/data/titanic_project.csv).
