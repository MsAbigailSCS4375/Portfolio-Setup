# Portfolio-Setup
This is my portfolio setup for Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 4375.004). 

# Assignment "Portfolio Setup"
I was successful in setting up my Github for this course! For this assignment, you can see my [overview of machine learning](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/overview_of_machine_learning.pdf).

# Assignment "C++ Data Exploration" C++_Data_Exploration.pdf
This assignment was focused on exploring how C++ and R differ when exploring data. You can see my [C++ Data Exploration code](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/CS4375_DataExploration.cpp)), my [documentation](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), as well as a [short runtime log](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/log_C++_Data_Exploration.txt).
