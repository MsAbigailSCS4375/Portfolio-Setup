# Portfolio-Setup
This is my portfolio setup for Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 4375.004). 

# Assignment "Portfolio Setup"
I was successful in setting up my Github for this course! For this assignment, you can see my [overview of machine learning](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/overview_of_machine_learning.pdf).

# Assignment "C++ Data Exploration"
This assignment was focused on exploring how C++ and R differ when exploring data. You can see my [C++ Data Exploration code](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/f452ceaa9b6fe1d25aa338be793007fa54adfd80/CS4375_DataExploration.cpp), my [documentation](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/f452ceaa9b6fe1d25aa338be793007fa54adfd80/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), as well as a [short runtime log](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/c031e661533010a954c887902e843012bf64fb8b/log_C++_Data_Exploration.txt).

# Assignment "Linear Models"
This assignment was focused on exploring linear regression and classification. I had worked with [Eric Shields](https://github.com/hampster2018/CS-4375-Machine-Learning) on this assignment. You can see our [Regression PDF](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/2289bf954f5dfc6ff562d948bfe52d4226354af0/Linear%20Models/Regression_from_Word.pdf), [Regression code](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/a7e0a65cd7a54bd3c7bb7fe15aaf38f72ad508bf/Linear%20Models/Regression.Rmd), [Classification PDF](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/97f84100a05afc1c66a5a4b9288c8c7aa6e64779/Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf), and [Classification Code](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/a7e0a65cd7a54bd3c7bb7fe15aaf38f72ad508bf/Linear%20Models/Classification.Rmd).
