# Portfolio-Setup
This is my portfolio setup for Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 4375.004). 

# Assignment "Portfolio Setup"
I was successful in setting up my Github for this course! For this assignment, you can see my [overview of machine learning](https://msabigailscs4375.github.io/Portfolio-Setup/overview_of_machine_learning.pdf).

# Assignment "C++ Data Exploration"
This assignment was focused on exploring how C++ and R differ when exploring data. You can see my [C++ Data Exploration code](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/f452ceaa9b6fe1d25aa338be793007fa54adfd80/CS4375_DataExploration.cpp), my [documentation](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/f452ceaa9b6fe1d25aa338be793007fa54adfd80/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), as well as a [short runtime log](https://github.com/MsAbigailSCS4375/Portfolio-Setup/blob/c031e661533010a954c887902e843012bf64fb8b/log_C++_Data_Exploration.txt).
